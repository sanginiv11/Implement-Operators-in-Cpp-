Aim (01): Calculate student's grade.
Theory: This C++ program calculates a student's average percentage and grade based on the marks entered for five subjects. It takes input for marks, labeled 'm1' through 'm5'. The program computes the average using the formula '(m1 + m2 + m3 + m4 + m5) / 5.0' and then displays the percentage. It uses 'if-else' statements to check the percentage range and print the corresponding grade, such as "O", "A+", or "B". If the average is below 40, it will print "Fail". This program shows how to use conditional logic, perform arithmetic operations, and handle basic input/output in C++.

Aim(02): Check whether the number is positive or negative.
Theory: This C++ program checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero. It takes an integer input from the user and uses 'if-else' statements to evaluate the number. If the number is greater than 0, it prints that it is positive. If it is less than 0, it prints that it is negative. Otherwise, it prints that the number is zero. This program shows how to use conditional statements and basic input/output in C++.

Aim(03): To find coordiantes are from which quadrant
Theory:  This C++ program finds the location of a point in the coordinate plane based on its 'x' and 'y' values. The user types in the coordinates, and then, using a series of 'if-else' statements, the program checks which quadrant the point is in:
* both 'x' and 'y' are positive in Quadrant I
* 'x' is negative and 'y' is positive in Quadrant II
* both 'x' and 'y' are negative in Quadrant III
* 'x' is positive and 'y' is negative in Quadrant IV
* if both are zero, the point is on the origin
* if 'x' is zero, the point is on the Y-axis
* if 'y' is zero, the point is on the X-axis

It illustrates the use of logical operators and conditional statements in the context of decision making
Conclusion: The programs illustrate the application of operators in C++, applying arithmetic for calculating average and percentage, and relational for determining whether a number is positive, negative, or zero. Also third program uses the 'x' and 'y' values to determine where in the coordinate plane that point lies. All the examples illustrate how the combination of operators and decision-making structures can help in programming to solve real-world problems in C++.
